I'm an incoming Assistant Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Michigan, starting in Fall 2023. I work on distributed control theory with applications to neuroscience, biology, and engineering systems. I received a B.A.Sc. in Engineering Science from the University of Toronto in 2018, and am currently wrapping up my PhD in Control + Dynamical Systems at Caltech. Outside of work, I enjoy playing, composing, producing, and listening to music. Iâ€™ve also had the joy of working as a private piano and vocal music instructor for children and adults.

This website is currently under construction. If you are a current or prospective master's or PhD student interested in working with me, send me an email with your resume and a short description of your research interests. I can be reached at jsli at caltech dot edu.
