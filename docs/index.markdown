![](/assets/profile_picture.JPG){:align="left" width="225"}I'm a 4th year PhD candidate in Control + Dynamics Systems at Caltech, advised by Professor John C. Doyle. I work on distributed control theory with applications to cyberphysical systems and biology models; my research is partially supported by an NSERC PGSD. I received a B.A.Sc. from the University of Toronto in 2018.

### **Research Overview**
My work is motivated by diverse applications from two complementary perspectives:

1. The *engineering* perspective, in which we wish to *design* cyberphysical systems that perform optimally, efficiently, robustly, etc.
2. The *biological* perspective, in which we wish to *decipher* how organisms are able to perform optimally, efficiently, robustly, etc.

These perspectives are symbiotic; organisms have inspired techniques in engineering, and engineering tools form the basis for many models of biological systems. I work on broad theoretical problems motivated by both perspectives, and also collaborate with engineers and biologists to produce and apply theory with with varying levels of application specificity.

My core expertise is in *control theory*, which concerns the study and operation of dynamical systems; this is a useful tool to understand both cyberphysical systems and biology. It is applicable to the design and analysis of flying (whether as a plane or a fruit fly); of traversing uneven terrain (whether as a Mars rover or a cat); and of power systems, especially as the introduction of renewables subjects the grid to increased instability and transient perturbations. Much of my work focuses on *distributed*, *local*, and *scalable* control theory. One common aspect of the dynamical systems described above is that they are extremely large; their size prohibits the use of traditional centralized techniques, which often lack scalability and are unable to accommodate constraints that are typical of large systems (e.g. slow communication between distant components). By advancing the state-of-the-art in distributed control theory, we form the basis for better engineering tools and better modeling tools for biology.
