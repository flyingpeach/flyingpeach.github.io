I'm an incoming Assistant Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Michigan, starting in Fall 2023. I work on distributed control theory with applications to neuroscience, biology, and engineering systems. I received a B.A.Sc. in Engineering Science from the University of Toronto in 2018, and am currently wrapping up my PhD in Control + Dynamical Systems at Caltech. Outside of work, I enjoy playing, composing, producing, and listening to music. Iâ€™ve also had the joy of working as a private piano and vocal music instructor for children and adults.

If you are a current or prospective master's or PhD student interested in working with me, send me an email with your resume and a short description of your research interests. Students should have experience or coursework in control theory or related fields. Background in neuroscience and biology is welcome, but not required -- curiosity and willingness to learn are all I require on these fronts. I can be reached at jsli at caltech dot edu.

Open access to research is important to me. I endeavor to make some version of all my papers available on [arXiV](https://arxiv.org/){:target="_blank"} and [biorXiV](https://www.biorxiv.org/){:target="_blank"}.

## **Research overview**

In engineering, control theory plays a crucial role in the design and analysis of robust and efficient systems -- including robots, spacecraft, and power grids. In neuroscience, control theory underlies models of motor and sensorimotor function. Control theory also has applications as a modeling tool for various biological processes, such as metabolic dynamics. I am interested in control-theoretic analysis of biological systems, which yields novel scientific explanations as well as valuable design insights, which can be applied to engineering systems.

The three foundational directions of my research are: 

<span style="color:#4ECA21;">**(1)**</span> develop theory for the design and implementation of controllers under various energy and signaling constraints 

<span style="color:#FF477E;">**(2)**</span> apply theory to develop novel models and insights for living systems, and 

<span style="color:#CE47FF;">**(3)**</span> apply theory to create scalable, robust, efficient algorithms and architectures.

I am particularly interested in how biology co-designs and implements controllers using organic components, which face unique challenges compared to their electronic counterparts.

The marriage of control theory and biology is far from new, but it is an unfamiliar union to many engineers and scientists. For engineers and control theorists who wonder why one might choose biology as a main application, I offer up [the following explanation](./why_biology.html). Conversely, for neuroscientists and biologists who are curious about controls, I elaborate on some unique benefits of control theory as a modeling tool [here](./why_controls.html). These snippets are adapted from my PhD thesis.
