![](/assets/profile_picture.jpg){:align="left" width="225"}I'm a 4th year PhD candidate in Control + Dynamics Systems at Caltech, advised by Professor John Doyle. I work on distributed control theory with applications to cyberphysical systems and biology models; my research is partially supported by an NSERC PGSD. I received a B.A.Sc. from the University of Toronto in 2018.
