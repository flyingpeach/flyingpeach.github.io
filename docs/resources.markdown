#### Academic job search
I found the blog posts from [Kira Goldner](https://www.kiragoldner.com/blog/index.html){:target="_blank"} and [Sylvia Herbert](http://sylviaherbert.com/faculty-application-advice){:target="_blank"} detailed and helpful. I also share my own job application materials, in the hopes that it will be helpful for someone else: [research statement](/assets/jsli_research_statement_jan16.pdf){:target="_blank"}, [teaching statement](/assets/jsli_teaching_statement_nov01.pdf){:target="_blank"}, and [DEI statement](/assets/jsli_dei_statement_nov01.pdf){:target="_blank"}.
