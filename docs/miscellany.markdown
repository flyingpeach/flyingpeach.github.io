### **Miscellany**

My Erdős number is 4. [This tool](https://www.csauthors.net/distance){:target="_blank"} is handy for finding your Erdős number (or your distance to any CS-adjacent academic).

#### **Academic job search**
I found the blog posts from [Kira Goldner](https://www.kiragoldner.com/blog/index.html){:target="_blank"} and [Sylvia Herbert](http://sylviaherbert.com/faculty-application-advice){:target="_blank"} to be informative and helpful. I also share my own job application materials, in the hopes that it will be helpful for someone else: [research statement](/assets/jsli_research_statement_jan16.pdf){:target="_blank"}, [teaching statement](/assets/jsli_teaching_statement_nov01.pdf){:target="_blank"}, and [DEI statement](/assets/jsli_dei_statement_nov01.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

#### **Algebraic structures**
My attempt at mapping out various algebraic structures in an aesthetically pleasing manner (not particularly related to my research).
