### **For prospective students**

I am currently open to working with students of all levels. I am not currently hiring postdocs. If you are interested in joining the team, you should have some experience or coursework in control theory, and ideally some experience with MATLAB or Python. 

I can be reached at jslisali at umich dot edu. While I am happy to answer questions about research and mentorship via email, I typically do not meet with students (in-person or virtual) unless they are already at U of M.

If you are a prospective PhD student, apply to the ECE program and include my name as an advisor you are interested in working with. Instructions can be found on the departmental webpage.

If you are a current UofM student, send me an email with your CV, research interests, and whether you plan to work with me formally (e.g. by signing up for a directed study with me) or informally. If you want to work with me informally, please provide an estimated number of hours per week you are planning to devote to our research.
